            <h3>I decided to create an HDR photo gallery of US National Parks and some inspiring places while traveling my partner Hilde (who is an incredible supporter of this project).</h3>
            <h3>HDR photography is a technique that reveals hidden details by merging several photos with different exposures.</h3>
            <h3>I will update this site whenever I get new material ready and find internet connection. Thanks for checking it out!</h3>
